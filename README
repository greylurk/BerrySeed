A BerrySeed application is composed of several basic components:

1) A Main Application which is an instance of a QNXAirApplication object.   
This application acts as a container for the navigation components.  This
handles the top-swipe event to show a navigation panel, and provides the 
foundational navigation metaphor.  It also provides a "toolbar" at the top 
of every page.

2) One or more Screens, which are added to the Application and serve as
the main user interface for the application.  Each application is made
up of multiple screens, which can be navigated between using the top-swipe
navigation bar.
